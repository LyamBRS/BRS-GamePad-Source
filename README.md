# BRS - GamePad

## **Summary:**
    This repository contains the source code of Gamepad, a BRS BrSpand card made to work with BRS Kontrol.
    This repository contains the pre-compiled code that is programmed on Gamepad's ESP32-S3 and is the  repository to go to to update your Gamepad's software directly. This repository also contains Unit Tests     programs which are used to ensure that every function works as intended through hardware tests.

## **What is Gamepad?**
    Gamepad is a BrSpand extension card which uses an ESP32-S3 along with 5 mechanical switches and 2 joysticks     to give Kontrol's users an extension and more physical control on whatever Kontrol is handling.
    Gamepad is a physical device. Thus it is not possible to run this program on any ESP32-S3 dev board and     expect it to work with their provided hardware.

## **Important information regarding other repositories:**
